Sherlock is stuck. He has an array A1,A2,⋯,AN. He wants to know if there exists a subset, B={Ai1,Ai2,…,Aik} where 1≤i1<i2<…<ik≤N, of this array which follows the property

B is non-empty subset.
There exists no integer x(x>1) which divides all elements of B. Note that x may or may not be an element of A.
Input Format 
First line contains T, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of N in one line. The next line contains N integers denoting the array A.

Output 
Print YES or NO, if there exists any such subset or not, respectively.

Constraints 
1≤T≤10 
1≤N≤100 
1≤Ai≤105 ∀1≤i≤N

Sample output

YES
NO
Explanation 
In first testcase, S={1},S={1,2},S={1,3},S={2,3} and S={1,2,3} are all the possible subsets which satisfy the given condition. 
In second testcase, no non-empty subset exists which satisfies the given condition.
